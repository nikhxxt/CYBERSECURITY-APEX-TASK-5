## OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)

OpenVAS, now integrated into the **Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)** suite, is a robust, enterprise-level tool designed for deep and thorough vulnerability scanning.

### 🔍 Main Function:
Performs automated scans—both authenticated and unauthenticated—to determine whether active services are vulnerable to exploitation.

### ⚙️ Scan Depth:
Surpasses tools like Nmap by conducting advanced checks, such as identifying missing patches, weak SSL configurations, and insecure system settings.

### 🧠 Standout Feature:
Relies on an extensive and regularly updated library of **Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)** to detect the latest CVEs and security issues.

### 🖥️ Deployment:
Typically operates as a server-based component within the **GVM framework**, managed through a web interface for scan scheduling and report generation.

### 📊 Reporting Capabilities:
Ideal for audits and compliance, it produces detailed reports that classify vulnerabilities by severity (High, Medium, Low) and offer targeted mitigation recommendations.
